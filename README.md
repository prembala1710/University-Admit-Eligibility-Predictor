###      :mortar_board: Project Description:
In this Project we will be building a University Admit Eligibility Predictor which will be able to
-      Predict the Possibilities of a Student to Apply to a Specific University
-      If Less Possible , It will Suggest with the Closest Universities Possible
-      For Universities not in the Student's Native Place , a English Test is Conducted
-      If he scores enough marks in the Test , then He will have a Higher chance, Since he will be able to make up for the Communication gap 

###      :mortar_board: Project Objectives:
By the end of this project, Youâ€™ll be able to understand :
-      Regression and Classification Problems
-      To Grab Insights from data through Visualization
-      Applying Different Algorithms accordingly
-      Evaluation Metrics
-      How to Build a Web Application using the Flask Framework
